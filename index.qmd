::: {#hero-heading}

Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the department of political science, Rice University. I also serve as a graduate assistant of [*International Organization*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization).

My research interests center on human rights advocacy and historically marginalized populations. In my dissertation, I investigate the effectiveness of cooperating NGO activism on human rights discourse at the international organizations.

Before attending Rice University as a Fulbright scholar, I received Bachelor in Law (2017) and Master in Political Science (2018) at Kobe University, Japan.
